I'm a student of computer programming, starting to look for roles in the development industry. As a student completing my studies in this field of work, I am excited to get a position in the job market to be able to share my skills and also be able to learn and better absorb what a successful developer's career is like.

As such, I studied some subjects like C# object-oriented, C# Asp.net MVC Core, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS among others. And now I would like to be able to put this experience into practice and improve my skills.

Always looking for opportunities to acquire knowledge, learn and add to a work team.
